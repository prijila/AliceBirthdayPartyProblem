# AliceBirthdayPartyProblem

Problem I :-

Alice invites her friends Bob and Bertha to her birthday party. Naturally, she uses an encrypted email. Eve, however, did not get invited, but she eavesdropped on the encrypted emails intended for Bob and Bertha. Based on the public certificates of Bob and Bertha, Eve extracted their corresponding public keys (N, e1) and (N, e2). Eve then noticed that Bob and Bertha use the same modulus N. Can Eve decrypt the messages with this information?


Problem II :-

Alice has learned from last year's mistake and no longer sends encrypted emails to recipients who use the same RSA modulus N. This year, she invites her friends Bob, Bertha, and Birte to her birthday party. Thus, Alice sends the same message to all three of her friends, encrypted with their respective public RSA keys. Is Eve again able to decrypt the cipher texts and thereby find out when and where the party will take place?
